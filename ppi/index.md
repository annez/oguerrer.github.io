title: Policy Priority Inference (PPI)
---

PPI is a computational framework created to understand the complexity of policy prioritization and to support decision-making when reallocating transformative resources with the aim of reaching a set of development goals.


## Context: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The 2030 Agenda Declaration of the United Nations highlights the importance of understanding development as a process where numerous policy dimensions interact with each other: "*The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized*".
Governments, NGOs and multilateral organizations quantify the progress in these many policy issues through development indicators.
However, how can we make sense of hundreds of indicators when they are interlinked?
With these interlinkages inducing non-linearities, feedback loops and spillovers, how  can policymakers identify the impact of public expenditure?
How can governments prioritize investing in certain topics in order to reach their goals?
Which policy issues can operate as accelerators towards these goals?
How can society evaluate the feasibility of such goals?
These and other related questions live at the center of public debate in international forums and development agendas.
They are intrinsically connected to the complexity of policy prioritization, and they their answers require new analytic tools.


## Development as a complex process

PPI combines knowledge from Complexity Economics, Computational Social Science, Behavioral Sciences and Policy Sciences in a computational framework.
It views the economy as a complex adaptive system where micro-level policy interventions give place to macro-level outcomes.
These outomes, int turn, feed back to policymakers who adapt their interventions with the aim of achieving certain development goals.

In the real world, macro-level outcomes are typically measured through development indicators.
However, data on the micro-level policymaking process tend to be scarse, at least in a similar scale and systematic nature as those of development indicators.
In view of such limitations, PPI simulates the macro-level dynamics of development indicators through a computational model of the policymaking process and the political economy that shapes the choices of rationally-bounded agents.
More specifically, PPI models a central authority that allocates transformative resources with the aim of improving indicators and reaching a set of goals.
