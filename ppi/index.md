title: Policy Priority Inference (PPI)
---

PPI is a computational framework created to understand the complexity of policy prioritization and to support decision-making when reallocating transformative resources with the aim of reaching specific development goals.


## Context: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The 2030 Agenda Declaration of the United Nations highlights the importance of understanding development as a process where numerous policy dimensions interact with each other: "*The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized*".
Governments, NGOs and multilateral organizations quantify the progress in these many policy issues through development indicators.
Officially, the UN members have agreed on tracking their progress to the 17 SDGs through 200+ indicators.
Nevertheless, different countries have more indicators that are highly specific to their socioeconomic context.
Then, how can we make sense of hundreds of indicators when they are interlinked?
With these interlinkages inducing non-linearities, feedback loops and spillovers, how  can policymakers identify the impact of public expenditure?
How can governments prioritize investing in certain topics in order to reach their goals?
Which policy issues can operate as accelerators towards these goals?
How can society evaluate the feasibility of such goals?
These and other related questions live at the center of public debate in international forums and development agendas.
They are intrinsically connected to the complexity of policy prioritization, and they their answers require new analytic tools.

## Development as a complex process

PPI combines knowledge from Complexity Economics, Computational Social Science, Behavioral Sciences, and Policy Sciences in a computational framework.
It views the economy as a complex adaptive system where micro-level policy interventions give place to macro-level outcomes.
These outomes, in turn, feed back into policymakers who adapt their interventions with the aim of achieving certain development goals.
These micro-macro-micro causal mechanisms are difficult to analyze with traditional statistical tools, specially if not comprehensive multi-level data exists. 

In the real world, macro-level outcomes are typically measured through development indicators.
However, data on the micro-level policymaking process tend to be scarse, at least in a similar scale and systematic nature as those of development indicators.
In view of such limitations, PPI simulates the macro-level dynamics of development indicators through a computational model of the policymaking process and of the political economy that shapes the choices of rationally-bounded policymakers.
More specifically, PPI simulates a *central authority* that allocates transformative resources with the aim of improving indicators and reaching a set of goals.
In the simulation, these resources are transformed into policy outcomes by *policy agents*, each one representing the public official or government agencies in charge of improving the relevant development indicators.
The macro-level dynamics of the simulated indicators depend on (1) the amount of resources allocated by the central authority, (2) the policy agents' efficiency, and (3) the interlinkages with other policy issues (for example, because industrial growth may hinder environmental progress).
With this, PPI can be calibrated to generate synthetic development indicators with properties that match those observed in real-world data.
In this case, PPI's theoretical variables (those at the micro-level that are unobservable in the real wordl) are informative about the how governments reach gevelopment goals.
Thus, PPI can exploit publicly accessible development-indicator data to provide several useful inferences about how governments can achieve the SDGs.

## How can I use it?

These are some of the topics in which PPI can support decision-making:

- *Allocating transformative resources*: It can be used to inform governments on how to better allocate transformative resources across numerous interdependent policy issues with the aim of reaching a set of goals that have been established in the natinoal or sub-national development plans. *Transformative* refers to those resources destined to generate changes in development indicators beyond those already set in motion by commited expenditure (like maintaining highways and hospitals).

- *Evaluating feasibility*: Given the indicators' historical trends, PPI can be employed to estimate how long it would take to reach a set of goals. Therefore, it is possible to assess whether such goals are feasible or not.

- *Estimating inefficiencies*: PPI can provide estimates on the level of efficiency within each policy issue; that is, how much the relevant indicator improves with each unit of additional investment in transformative resources.

- *Setting development goals*: Since it is possible to evaluate the goal feasibility, PPI can be used to explore a vast space of goals in order to choose those that better a government's constraints (for example, term duration, budget, inefficiencies, etc.).

- *Measuring policy coherence*: IPP can generate counterfactials of policy priorities; that is, simulated allocations that are conducive to a set of goals, and that may defer from a governments' factual priorities. These simulations are the basis for a quantitative index that is informative of how coherent are a government's priorities with respect to the goals that it has set and/or promotes through public discourse.

- *Discovering accelerators*: The tool's flexibility facilitates conducting experiments where one can reallocate resources in order to find those policy issues that cathalyze development not only in their own indicator, but across many others.
    
- *Identifying bottlenecks*: The counterpart of an accelerator is a bottleneck. PPI can be employed to find those policy issues where a lack of transformative resources, negative linterlinkages, or high inefficiencies delay convergence towards the established goals.
    
- *Accounting for fiscal rigidity*: Often, legislation restricts the fluidity of resources across policy issues. PPI can take this into account to improve the above inferences, or to evaluate when these rigidities are beneficial and when they are detrimental.

- *Estimating the impact of changing the budget size*: PPI can help understanding how an increase or decrease in the availability of transformative resources may accelerate or slow down convergence to the established goals. This is a concern, for example, among countries where an aging population if forcing governments to shirnk the amount of available transformative resources in order to fulfill other non-transformative commitments such such as paying pensions.
