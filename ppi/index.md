title: Policy Priority Inference (PPI)
---

PPI is a computational framework created to understand the complexity of policy prioritization and to support planning and evaluation activities when reallocating transformative resources with the aim of reaching a set of development goals.


## Context: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The 2030 Agenda Declaration of United Nations highlights the importance of understanding development as a process with numerous dimensions that interact with each other: "*The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized*". Traditionally, governments, NGOs and multilateral organizations have quantified progress in such numerous dimensions through development indicators. However, how can we make sense of hundreds of indicators when they are interdependent? Moreover, how can policymakers establish policy priorities when such interdependencies produce spillover effects and encourage the inefficient use of resources?
