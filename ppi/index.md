title: Policy Priority Inference (PPI)
---

PPI is a computational framework created to understand the complexity of policy prioritization and to support decision-making when reallocating transformative resources with the aim of reaching specific development goals.


## Context: the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The 2030 Agenda Declaration of the United Nations highlights the importance of understanding development as a process where numerous policy dimensions interact with each other: "*The interlinkages and integrated nature of the SDGs are of crucial importance in ensuring that the purpose of the new Agenda is realized*".
Governments, NGOs and multilateral organizations quantify the progress in these many policy issues through development indicators.
Officially, the UN members have agreed on tracking their progress to the 17 SDGs through 200+ indicators.
Nevertheless, different countries have more indicators that are highly specific to their socioeconomic context.
Then, how can we make sense of hundreds of indicators when they are interlinked?
With these interlinkages inducing non-linearities, feedback loops and spillovers, how  can policymakers identify the impact of public expenditure?
How can governments prioritize investing in certain topics in order to reach their goals?
Which policy issues can operate as accelerators towards these goals?
How can society evaluate the feasibility of such goals?
These and other related questions live at the center of public debate in international forums and development agendas.
They are intrinsically connected to the complexity of policy prioritization, and they their answers require new analytic tools.


## Development as a complex process

PPI combines knowledge from Complexity Economics, Computational Social Science, Behavioral Sciences, and Policy Sciences in a computational framework.
It views the economy as a complex adaptive system where micro-level policy interventions give place to macro-level outcomes.
These outomes, in turn, feed back into policymakers who adapt their interventions with the aim of achieving certain development goals.
These micro-macro-micro causal mechanisms are difficult to analyze with traditional statistical tools, specially if not comprehensive multi-level data exists. 

In the real world, macro-level outcomes are typically measured through development indicators.
However, data on the micro-level policymaking process tend to be scarse, at least in a similar scale and systematic nature as those of development indicators.
In view of such limitations, PPI simulates the macro-level dynamics of development indicators through a computational model of the policymaking process and of the political economy that shapes the choices of rationally-bounded policymakers.
More specifically, PPI simulates a *central authority* that allocates transformative resources with the aim of improving indicators and reaching a set of goals.
In the simulation, these resources are transformed into policy outcomes by *policy agents*, each one representing the public official or government agencies in charge of improving the relevant development indicators.
The macro-level dynamics of the simulated indicators depend on (1) the amount of resources allocated by the central authority, (2) the policy agents' efficiency, and (3) the interlinkages with other policy issues (for example, because industrial growth may hinder environmental progress).
With this, PPI can be calibrated to generate synthetic development indicators with properties that match those observed in real-world data.
In this case, PPI's theoretical variables (those at the micro-level that are unobservable in the real wordl) are informative about the how governments reach gevelopment goals.
Thus, PPI can exploit publicly accessible development-indicator data to provide several useful inferences about how governments can achieve the SDGs.
