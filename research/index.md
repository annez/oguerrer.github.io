I work on a variety of topics related to economics and policy interventions.
I am also running various projects that you can find in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="[https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01095-1](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5ft7NZkAAAAJ)">Google Scholar</a>

If you are interested in my work in progress or you do not have a subscription to the journals where I have published, feel free to contact me and I will be happy to provide the manuscripts. You can find related policy reports in the PPI section and media coverage in the Press section.
