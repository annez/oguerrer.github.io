I am interested in a variety of topics related to economics and policy interventions.
Here are my academic publications organized by theme.
If you are interested in my work in progress or you do not have a subscription to the journals where I have published, feel free to contact me and I will be happy to provide the manuscripts.
Some of this research has also produced policy impact.
You can find elated policy reports in the PPI section and media coverage in the Press section.


## Policy Priority Inference
This is a research program that uses agent-computing models to link public spending and development indicators.
This research provides governments and other types of organizations with tools to better determine budgetary priorities when they want to reach a set of goals for their indicators.
This agenda has been produced in collaboration with Gonzalo Castañeda (CIDE).

## Housing Markets
This research looks at problems related to housing inequality.
Currently, I have produced one publication in this space, but I am working with Stephen Law (UCL) in order to build holistic models that incorporate spatial features, highly granular property data, financial institutions, and realistic economic behaviors.

## Labor Flow Networks
This research agenda has been constructed in collaboration with Robert Axtell and Eduardo López (George Mason University).
This research was the first to introduced the idea of thinking about labour dynamics as workers flowing through networks (where such networks represnt the structure of the labor market), coining the term `Labor Flow Network` (LFN).
We have produced different types of models (mathematical and computational) to analyze highly granular dataset of employee-employer matched records and to understand better the consequences of economic shocks.
Currently, I am working with Áron Pap (Barcelona Graduate School of Economics) and with the UK Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) in order to develop models that can explain LFNs from bottom-up through agent-computing; something extremely useful to understand the impact of strong shocks and to design nuanced policy interventions.

## Vote Trading Networks
This collaboration with Ulrich Matter (University of St Gallen) has produced a methodology to quantify the hidden behavior of vote trading (known as logrolling in the US) in congresses and parliaments.
Our approach is the first to provide a systemic view of the problem, so researchers can use it to exploit large-scale roll call data from different institutions.
