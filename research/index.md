I work on a variety of topics related to economics and policy interventions.
I am also running various projects that you can find in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://turingcss.org">website of my research group</a>.
One of the largest projects under active development is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://policypriority.org">Policy Priority Inference</a>, which has numerous academic and policy publications.
For an udated list of my academic cork, see my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01095-1">Google Scholar</a>.
