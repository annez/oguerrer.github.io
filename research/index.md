I work on a variety of topics related to economics, politics, and public policy.
I also run different projects that you can find in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://turingcss.org">website of my research group</a>.
One of the largest projects under active development is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://policypriority.org">Policy Priority Inference</a>, which has numerous academic and policy publications.
