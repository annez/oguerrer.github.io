I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Economics in University College London and at The Alan Turing Institute. I enjoy studying problems that involve economic behavior and institutions. Currently, I am working on topics related to firm-labor dynamics, political behavior, economic development and inequality. My main interest lies in building models with explicit social mechanisms that can be used to inform policy. Usually, this involves computational simulations of multi-agent systems, complex networks and data science. My aim is to advance the computational social sciences and make them an integral part of the toolbox of every social scientist. I am currently developing research programs to address these topics. If you wish to learn more or get involved do not hesitate in contacting me.
