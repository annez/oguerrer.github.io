I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute, and I lead the Policy Modelling Theme at the Institute's Public Policy Programme.
I am an economist with a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University.
Previously, I worked at University College London and at Oxford University.
I do research on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours.
I also enjoy translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading me to work with various governments and international organisations around the world.
At the moment, I am working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.
