I am an ESRC-Alan Turing Institute Fellow and a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Economics in University College London.
I enjoy studying problems that involve economic behavior and institutions from an interdisciplinary angle.
Currently, I am working on topics related to firm-labor dynamics, political behavior, economic development and inequality.
My main interest lies in building models with explicit social mechanisms that can be used to inform policy.
Usually, this involves computational simulations of multi-agent systems, complex networks and data science.
I am currently developing research programs in these areas, so you can find further information in this site.
If you wish to learn more or get involved do not hesitate in contacting me at oguerrero@turing.ac.uk.
