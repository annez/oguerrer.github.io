I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research at The Alan Turing Institute, and I lead the Policy Modelling Theme at the Institute's Public Policy Programme.
I am an economist by training, and I have a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University.
Previously, I was a Senior Research Fellow at University College London (Department of Economics) and in Oxford University (at the Sa√Ød Business School and at the Institute for New Economic Thinking).
I work on different aspects of CSS, including methodological research, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours.
I also enjoy translating my research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, which has led me to work with various governments and international organisations around the world.
At the moment, I am working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.
