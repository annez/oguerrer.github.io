I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute.
I also have the privilege of leading this group of talented scholars at the Turing (see the group's website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://turingcss.org">here</a>).
I am an economist with a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University.
Previously, I worked at the Department of Economics of University College London and, before that, at Oxford University, in the Sa√Ød Business School and in the Institute for New Economic Thinking.
I conduct research on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours.
I also enjoy translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading me to work with various governments and international organisations.
At the moment, I am working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.
If you wish to learn more or get involved do not hesitate in contacting me at oguerrero@turing.ac.uk.
