I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute.
I also have the privilege of leading this group of talented scholars at the Turing (see the group's website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://turingcss.org">here</a>).
I am an economist with a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University.
I conduct research on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours.
I also enjoy translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading me to work with various governments and international organisations.
At the moment, I am working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.
