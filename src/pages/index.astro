      I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. At the Turing, I have the privilege of leading the <a target="_blank" href="https://turingcss.org">Computational Social Science Group</a>. I work on problems related to economics and policy interventions, and I try to transform much of my research into tools that are useful to economists in governments departments, regulators, local authorities, and international organisations. Currently, I work on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality. I am passionate about deploying different methods (as well as learning new ones) that can help us improving our understanding of economics in new and important ways.

	I am an economist with an interdisciplinary PhD in Computational Social Science Group (CSS). When I decided to go to graduate school, I wanted to continue doing economics and learn more up-to-date computational methods. Unfortunately, no economics department was able to offer such skills, so I embarked in the first CSS PhD programme in the world while continued to doing econ coursework and research. During my PhD, I was very fortunate to land under the supervision of one of the pioneers in the field: <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K822uYQAAAAJ">Rob Axtell</a>. Then, before joining the Turing, I was a Senior Research Fellow at Oxford's Institute for New Economic Thinking, at the Sa√Ød Business School, and, subsequently, at UCL's Department of Economics. I am very familiar with the obstacles that students undergo when trying to find programmes that can teach them computational methods and to use them adequately to solve social-science problems, so feel free to reach out if you need advice.
