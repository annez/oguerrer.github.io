      I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute and I have the privilege of leading the <a target="_blank" href="https://turingcss.org">Computational Social Science</a> (CSS) Group of the Institute. I work on problems related to economics and policy interventions, and I try to transform much of this research into tools that are useful to economists in governments and international organisations. Currently, I work on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality. If you wish to learn more or get involved do not hesitate in contacting me at oguerrero@turing.ac.uk.

	I also I am an economist with a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University. I conduct research on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours. I also enjoy translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading me to work with various governments and international organisations. At the moment,
