title: 'Skills and productivity'
description: 'Methods to quantify skills complementarity'
explanation: 'One of the big challenges in fleshing out the underlying mechanisms of productivity is measuring how different skills come together to produce more, i.e. their complementarity. Typically, complementarity is approximated by looking at skill profiles that co-occur more often than expected. This research area takes a different (more direct) approach by proposing models that are explicit about the relationship between skills firm technology. At the moment, you can read my work with Zach Kessler on how we estimate the wage fraction that is due to complementarities (as opposed to their individual contributions). This is an active work stream so more publications will be posted soon.
