title: 'Technology and production networks'
description: 'Quantify technologies and their interactions'
explanation: 'Technology is central to understand production processes. This research area studies technology and its sole in production networks from different perspectives. A part of this work developed information-theory methods to measure how sophisticated technologies are. Another builds models of production networks that are agnostic of particular types of technologies in terms of needing to specify production functions to make them solvable. This is a growing work stream so more publications will be posted soon.'
