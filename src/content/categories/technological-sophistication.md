title: 'Technology and production networks'
description: 'Quantify technologies and their interactions'
explanation: 'Technology is central to understand production processes. This research area studies technology and its sole in production networks from different perspectives. A part of this work (with [Hardik Rajpal](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.rajpal15)) develops information-theory methods to measure how sophisticated technologies are. Another part (with [Tuong Vu](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/tuong-m-vu)) builds models of production networks that are agnostic of particular types of technologies in terms of needing to specify production functions to make them solvable. This is a growing work stream so more publications will be posted soon.'
