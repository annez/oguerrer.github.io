title: 'Housing markets and inequality'
description: 'High-resolution models of housing markets dynamics'
explanation: 'In this research area, I have developed incremental models that emerge the right cross-section of housing wealth across heterogeneous households. Progressively, these models have become more capable of reproducing highly granular statistical facts such as the spatial distribution of property prices and housing affordability; all from simple economic principles and without needing to statistically match household and property data (common in spatial analysis). Currently, I am working on a series of policy applications of these models to address crucial questions about the kind of regulations that policymakers and academics conjecture about, but that are difficult to properly assess ex-ante.'
