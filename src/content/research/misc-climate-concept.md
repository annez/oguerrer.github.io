In this methodological note, we propose a quantitative framework to develop a Climate and Security Index (CSI), for measuring and monitoring climate security vulnerability. Primarily meant for long-term planning and decision making for resilience building, it incorporates a broad range of drivers of the climate-security nexus, including those from climatic, conflict, socioeconomic, agricultural, and contextual (i.e., mitigating factors, adaptive capacity) dimensions, to indicate climate-security risks at subnational level. Emphasizing the role of water, land and food systems, a systemic approach, based on innovative modeling tools is envisioned, to account for the underlying relationships within the Climate Security Nexus.
